  "description": "Added `authorize_local()` instance methods on `AuthorizationCode` and `AsyncAuthorizationCode` in `spotify_sdk.auth` so local loopback auth can be started directly from the auth object (`auth.authorize_local()` / `await auth.authorize_local()`) while keeping function helpers for backward compatibility. ([#63](https://github.com/jonathan343/spotify-sdk/pull/63))"
